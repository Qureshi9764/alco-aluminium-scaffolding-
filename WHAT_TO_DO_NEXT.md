# 🎯 What To Do Next - Resend Email Setup

## ✅ What's Been Done

I've successfully implemented Resend email service in your Alcoa Scaffolding project. Here's what was completed:

1. ✅ **Installed Resend Package** - Added to backend dependencies
2. ✅ **Created Resend Service** - New email service using Resend API
3. ✅ **Updated Email Controller** - Automatically uses Resend when configured
4. ✅ **Updated All Email Addresses** - Changed from `alcoaaluminiumscaffolding1@gmail.com` to `Sales@alcoascaffolding.com`
5. ✅ **Created Documentation** - Complete setup guides and test scripts
6. ✅ **Your API Key Ready** - `re_CvdzT36t_7KHxdymvBesH1qdDRJ2a4yzm`

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (DO THIS NOW!)

### Step 1: Create `.env` File in Backend Folder

Navigate to your backend folder and create a file named `.env`:

**Path:** `D:\New folder\HYD\alcoa-scaffolding\backend\.env`

**Content:**
```env
# Resend Email Service
RESEND_API_KEY=re_CvdzT36t_7KHxdymvBesH1qdDRJ2a4yzm
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=Sales@alcoascaffolding.com

# Company Email
COMPANY_EMAIL=Sales@alcoascaffolding.com
SUPPORT_EMAIL=Sales@alcoascaffolding.com
SECONDARY_EMAIL=Sales@alcoascaffolding.com

# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development

# CORS Configuration
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

### Step 2: Start Backend Server

Open PowerShell in your project directory:

```powershell
cd "D:\New folder\HYD\alcoa-scaffolding\backend"
npm run dev
```

**✅ Success Indicator:**
Look for this message in console:
```
✅ Using Resend Email Service
```

If you see this, Resend is active! 🎉

### Step 3: Test the Setup

**Option A - Quick Test Script (Recommended):**
```powershell
cd backend
node test-resend.js
```

This will send test emails and verify everything works.

**Option B - Test Endpoint:**
```
Open browser: http://localhost:5000/api/email/test
```

**Option C - Use Your Contact Form:**
1. Start frontend: `npm run dev`
2. Go to your website
3. Fill out contact form
4. Check `Sales@alcoascaffolding.com` inbox

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Email Service Priority:

```
1. Check if RESEND_API_KEY exists in .env
   ├─ YES → Use Resend ✅ (Modern, reliable)
   └─ NO  → Use Nodemailer (Gmail/SendGrid)
```

### When User Submits Contact Form:

```
User Form → Backend Validation → Resend API → 2 Emails Sent:
                                                 ├─ 1. To You (Sales@alcoascaffolding.com)
                                                 └─ 2. To Customer (auto-reply)
```

## 🔐 Important Security Notes

1. **`.env` File:**
   - Contains sensitive API key
   - Already in `.gitignore` (won't be committed to Git)
   - Keep it secret, keep it safe!

2. **API Key:**
   - Your key: `re_CvdzT36t_7KHxdymvBesH1qdDRJ2a4yzm`
   - Don't share publicly
   - Rotate if compromised

3. **Production:**
   - Use different API keys for dev/production
   - Verify domain for better deliverability
   - Monitor usage regularly

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "RESEND_API_KEY not found"
**Solution:**
- Ensure `.env` file exists in `backend/` folder
- Check file name is exactly `.env` (not `.env.txt`)
- Restart server after creating `.env`

### Problem: "Still using Nodemailer"
**Solution:**
- Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` is set in `.env`
- No spaces or quotes around the value
- Restart the server
- Check console output

### Problem: "Emails not received"
**Solution:**
- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify `Sales@alcoascaffolding.com` is correct
- Check Resend dashboard for delivery status
- Run test script to diagnose

### Problem: "Test script errors"
**Solution:**
- Ensure you're in backend folder: `cd backend`
- Check `.env` file exists
- Verify API key is correct
